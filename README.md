## Managing the states 

In my project , I used cards state for getting the card API and its objects to display in my website. I used course name state for showing the courses added in the cart. I used credit state for displaying and conditioning the total credit which will not exceed by 20 . I used remaining credit for the remaining credit hours which will be subtracted by credit hours and the remaining credit hours is set to 20. As for selected card id state, it is use for not having two course name in the cart , for this I filtered card that if the same if exists then it will not add any same course name.
